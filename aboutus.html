    <h1><i>About us</i></h1>
    <h3>Down here in Florida, Gator Burger is devoted to its unique and tasty assortment of fine dining. Every burger, milkshake, and batch of fries is made with care and attention to detail, from the cheese melting of the meat of the burger, to the condensation coming off of the milkshake glass. But above all we value taste and use of spices and seasoning; every burger is made using unsalted butter, a tablespoon of maldon salt, garlic powder, black pepper, olive oil, and 2 slices of swiss cheese. So when you go out to order something tasty for the whole family make sure you stop by Gator Burger.</h3>
